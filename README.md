# Arduino Clock with 4 Servo Motors & Python Serial Sync

This project demonstrates a real-time clock built using an **Arduino** and **4 servo motors**, where each motor represents a digit of the current time (HH:MM). The time is updated every minute using a **Python script** that sends the system time to the Arduino via **serial communication**.

## üß† Concept

Each servo motor represents one digit of the 24-hour time format:
- 1st Servo: Tens place of the hour (e.g., `0` in 09:45)
- 2nd Servo: Units place of the hour (e.g., `9` in 09:45)
- 3rd Servo: Tens place of the minute (e.g., `4` in 09:45)
- 4th Servo: Units place of the minute (e.g., `5` in 09:45)

The Python script fetches the system time and sends it over serial to the Arduino every minute. The Arduino then maps each digit to the appropriate servo position.
